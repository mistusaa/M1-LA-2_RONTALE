Hi sir, you've mentioned that "Each time the player collects a star object, the color of the character must change in this order (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet)". But somehow my "Yellow" hex color doesnt work, for some reason it turns the player or character into a lightgreenish idk why maybe because it might have something to do with my player_spritesheet.png.. Thank U sir
